# libtiny3d
*A minimal 3D software renderer in pure C (no OpenGL/DirectX)*

## Overview

**libtiny3d** is a tiny, self-contained 3D software renderer written from scratch in C. It provides a basic environment to render 3D geometric objects onto a 2D canvas, without relying on hardware acceleration or external graphics libraries. All rendering, transformations, and lighting are handled in software using simple algorithms and data structures.

## Features

- **Canvas Drawing:** Draw pixels and lines (with thickness) in RGB colors.
- **3D Transformations:** Supports translation, rotation, and scaling via 4x4 matrices.
- **Projection Pipeline:** Full model → view → projection → screen mapping.
- **Geometric Objects:** Built-in support for cubes and truncated icosahedrons (soccer balls).
- **Wireframe Rendering:** Uses Bresenham or DDA algorithms for fast line drawing.
- **Lambertian Lighting:** Optional per-edge intensity using dot product (Lambertian reflectance).
- **Animation Loop:** Animate and export frame sequences as PGM images.
- **Modular Structure:** Clean separation of canvas, math, rendering, lighting, and animation code.

## Build & Run

### Prerequisites

- Linux environment
- GCC compiler
- `make` (optional, recommended)

### Quick Build (with Make)

```sh
make
```

### Manual Build (example)

```sh
gcc -Iinclude -o tests/test_cube tests/test_cube.c src/canvas.c src/math3d.c src/renderer.c src/lighting.c src/animation.c
gcc -Iinclude -o tests/test_soccer tests/test_soccer.c src/canvas.c src/math3d.c src/renderer.c src/lighting.c src/animation.c
```

## Running Visual Tests

After building, run the test executables to render animations as a series of PGM images.

### Render a Rotating Cube

```sh
./tests/test_cube
# Output: frames/cube_frame_000.pgm, cube_frame_001.pgm, ...
```

### Render a Rotating Soccer Ball

```sh
./tests/test_soccer
# Output: frames/soccer_frame_000.pgm, soccer_frame_001.pgm, ...
```

## Example Output

Below are sample frames generated by libtiny3d.  
*Replace these with real images from your output directory.*

| Rotating Cube      | Rotating Soccer Ball      |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| ![cube_frame_000](images/cube_frame_000.pgm)  | ![soccer_frame_000](images/soccer_frame_000.pgm) |
| ![cube_frame_016](images/cube_frame_016.pgm)  | ![soccer_frame_016](images/soccer_frame_016.pgm) |

*(PGM images are viewable in most image viewers or can be converted to PNG for easier sharing.)*
